# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

moqlivemock is a Go-based MoQ (Media over QUIC) live streaming mock implementation. It provides:

- **mlmpub**: A publisher that serves live media content over MoQ Transport
- **mlmsub**: A subscriber that receives and processes media streams

## Architecture

### LOCMAF Codec Module

- LOCMAF encode/decode comes from `github.com/Eyevinn/locmaf` (the reusable
  codec module; one packaging version at a time, reported by `locmaf.Version`).
  See `docs/LOCMAF.md`; the normative spec is the IETF draft
  draft-einarsson-moq-locmaf

### MoQ Transport Dependency

Uses `github.com/Eyevinn/moqtransport` (forked from mengelbart/moqtransport) with draft-14 and draft-16 support.
Version negotiation uses ALPN (`moqt-16` for draft-16, `moq-00` for draft-14) and `WT-Available-Protocols` for WebTransport.

### Multi-Namespace Architecture

mlmpub announces one or more namespaces. The CMSF namespaces carry a unified
catalog (draft-ietf-moq-msf-01) filtered by protection type; LOC uses an MSF
catalog; moq-mi is catalogless.

CMSF (unified CMAF + LOCMAF catalog):
- `cmsf/clear` — always present, clear (unencrypted) tracks
- `cmsf/drm-{scheme}` — when `-drmpath` is set, commercial DRM tracks (`_drm` suffix)
- `cmsf/eccp-{scheme}` — when `-kid`/`-iv` are set, ClearKey/ECCP tracks (`_eccp` suffix)

Each rendition appears twice in a CMSF catalog: a CMAF track `<name>`
(`packaging: "cmaf"`) and a LOCMAF track `<name>_locmaf`
(`packaging: "locmaf"`, `locmafVersion` from `locmaf.Version`, currently "0.3"), as alternates in the same
altGroup. Because LOCMAF init data is the raw CMAF init segment, both
variants reference one shared entry in the catalog `initDataList` via `initRef`
(draft-ietf-moq-msf-01). The serve path (`pub.PublishTrack`) picks the encoding
per track and strips the `_locmaf` suffix to resolve the underlying content
track.

Follow-up (not implemented): draft-ietf-moq-msf-01 §5.5/§12 define an OPTIONAL
`MSF_COMPRESSION` property to compress the catalog object payload. Catalogs are
emitted uncompressed today, which is fully conformant; the shared-init dedup
already removes most of the redundancy compression targets.

### LOCMAF specification versioning

One LOCMAF packaging version is supported at a time — the one implemented by
the `github.com/Eyevinn/locmaf` module and reported by `locmaf.Version`
(currently `"0.3"`); v0.2 remains reachable at the `locmaf-v0.2` tag. The
normative spec is the IETF Internet-Draft
[draft-einarsson-moq-locmaf](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-einarsson-moq-locmaf/);
see `docs/LOCMAF.md` for how moqlivemock uses the codec. The packaging version
and the IETF draft revision advance independently — cite the
version-independent draft URL, not a pinned revision.

LOC (raw codec frames, one per object) and moq-mi (catalogless):
- `msf/clear` — LOC packaging (AVC, HEVC, and AV1 video + AAC/Opus audio)
- `moq-mi/clear` — moq-mi packaging with fixed track names `video0` / `audio0`

Combined spatial AV1 SVC sources are projected only in the clear LOC catalog.
`Asset.GetLOCTrackByName` resolves virtual `<source>/s<ID>` tracks which share
source timing and sync state but carry layer-specific OBU payloads. Catalog
dependencies form a direct `s0 <- s1 <- s2` chain with no alternate group.
CMSF, LOCMAF, protection, and moq-mi retain the aggregate source track. LOC
objects add RFC 9626 frame marking and use priority `128 + spatial_id`; global
configuration remains on base-layer sync objects. `mlmsub` does not reconstruct
or merge these dependent tracks.

### Subtitle Tracks

Subtitles are dynamically generated (not loaded from files), showing UTC time
and group number, as WVTT (WebVTT in CMAF) or STPP (TTML in CMAF).

Track naming: `subs_wvtt_{lang}`, `subs_stpp_{lang}`

### Content Protection

ClearKey/ECCP (explicit `-kid`/`-iv` flags) and commercial DRM (a CPIX config
via `-drmpath`) are two independent modes: both are optional and both can be
active at the same time, in which case a rendition is published three times.

Track naming: clear tracks have no suffix, DRM tracks get `_drm`, ECCP tracks get `_eccp`.

### Video Codecs

Video tracks use `avc1` (H.264), `hvc1` (HEVC), and `av01` (AV1) sample
descriptors. AVC/HEVC store parameter sets (SPS/PPS for AVC, VPS/SPS/PPS for
HEVC) in the init segment rather than inlining them in each sample; this is
required for FairPlay DRM compatibility in Safari 26.4+. AV1 similarly carries
its decoder configuration (the sequence header OBU) in the `av1C` box of the
init segment (`internal/media.go` `AV1Data`, built via mp4ff's
`SetAV1Descriptor`). AV1 is offered through the CMSF namespaces (CMAF + LOCMAF variants) and the LOC
`msf/clear` namespace. For LOC the `av01` codec string is kept as-is (unlike
AVC/HEVC which switch to `avc3`/`hev1`) because the sequence header OBU already
travels in each keyframe temporal unit; `AV1Data.GenLOCVideoConfig` returns nil
when keyframes are self-contained and the sequence header OBU to prepend
otherwise. AV1 test assets are generated by `utils/contentgen` in low-delay CBR
mode (I/P only, no reordering).
The spatial-SVC fixture in `assets/testsvc` is generated through libaom's
`svc_encoder_rtc` and `utils/contentgen/svcivfmp4`; the packer combines equal-PTS
layer packets into one fragmented-MP4 temporal-unit sample.
Encryption works for AV1 too — the protection path is codec-agnostic and mp4ff
implements the AV1 CENC binding (only tile data encrypted, OBU headers clear),
so ClearKey/ECCP (`cenc`/`cbcs`) and commercial DRM all produce `_eccp`/`_drm`
AV1 tracks that round-trip correctly.

### Interop Testing (mlmtest)

`mlmtest` is an interop test client for [moq-interop-runner](https://github.com/englishm/moq-interop-runner).
It connects to a server/relay and runs protocol-level test cases with both draft-14 and draft-16, outputting TAP v14 results.
`go run ./cmd/mlmtest -l` lists the test cases.

moq-interop-runner drives it through environment variables rather than flags:

```bash
RELAY_URL=moqt://relay:443 TESTCASE=setup-only TLS_DISABLE_VERIFY=1 go run ./cmd/mlmtest
```
