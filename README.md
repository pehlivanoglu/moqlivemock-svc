moqlivemock is a simple media test service for [MOQ Transport][moqt]
and the [MSF][MSF]/[CMSF][CMSF] streaming format by providing a server which
publishes an asset with wall-clock synchronized multi-bitrate video,
audio tracks, and dynamically-generated subtitle tracks (WVTT and STPP),
as well as a client that can receive these streams and even multiplex
video and audio for playback with ffplay like `mlmsub -muxout - | ffplay -`.

Video tracks use `avc1` (H.264), `hvc1` (HEVC), and `av01` (AV1) sample
descriptors with decoder configuration stored in the init segment.

The input media is 10s of video and audio which is then disassembled
into frames. One or more frames are then combined into a MoQ object as a CMAF chunk.
How many frames are combined is configurable via the `-audiobatch` and `-videobatch` options.

Subtitles are generated on the fly and delivered as 1s groups with 1 object per group.
That object is published at the start of each second in order to not increase the latency.

### Wall-clock alignment

All streams are aligned to UTC wall-clock time at two levels:

1. **The 10-second asset loop** is aligned to UTC modulo 10 seconds.
   The first sample of the clip maps to epoch times where `seconds % 10 == 0`.
   This means every subscriber joining at the same wall-clock time receives
   the same content, regardless of when the publisher was started.
2. **MoQ groups** are aligned to full UTC seconds. Each group number is
   `Unix_epoch_ms / 1000`, so group boundaries fall on exact second boundaries.
   Audio is typically not compatible with integral seconds, so minimal
   displacement is applied without accumulated drift over time.

In addition to CMSF, mlmpub also announces an [LOC][LOC] (Low Overhead
Container) namespace and a [moq-mi][moq-mi] (MoQ Media Interop) namespace. Each
CMSF catalog additionally offers a LOCMAF (Low Overhead CMAF) variant of every
track. See the [Namespaces](#namespaces) section below for details.

This project uses [moqtransport][moqtransport] for the MoQ transport layer,
supporting both draft-14 and draft-16 of MOQT. Draft-16 uses ALPN-based version
negotiation (`moqt-16`) and `WT-Available-Protocols` for WebTransport. Draft-14
(`moq-00`) is supported for backward compatibility.

## Namespaces

mlmpub announces one or more namespaces depending on the configured packaging
and protection modes. Each CMSF/MSF namespace has its own catalog containing
only the relevant tracks; moq-mi is catalogless and uses fixed track names by
convention.

| Namespace | Packaging | Condition | Track suffix | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `cmsf/clear` | CMSF (CMAF chunks) | Always | *(none)* | Unencrypted tracks |
| `cmsf/drm-{scheme}` | CMSF (CMAF chunks) | `-drmpath` set | `_drm` | Commercial DRM (Widevine/PlayReady/FairPlay via CPIX) |
| `cmsf/eccp-{scheme}` | CMSF (CMAF chunks) | `-kid`/`-iv` set | `_eccp` | ClearKey/ECCP (explicit key over HTTP) |
| `msf/clear` | LOC ([draft-ietf-moq-loc][LOC]) | Always | *(none)* | AVC/HEVC/AV1 video + AAC/Opus audio, clear only |
| `moq-mi/clear` | moq-mi ([draft-cenzano-moq-media-interop][moq-mi]) | When asset has AVC + AAC-LC/Opus | *(none)* | Catalogless, fixed track names `video0` / `audio0` |

There is **no separate `locmaf/*` namespace**. The `cmsf/*` catalogs are
unified: each rendition is listed twice — as a CMAF track (`packaging: "cmaf"`)
and as a LOCMAF track `<name>_locmaf` (`packaging: "locmaf"`) sharing one
init-data entry. See [LOCMAF](#locmaf-within-the-cmsf-namespaces) below.

Both DRM and ECCP can be active simultaneously — they use independent encryption keys
and produce separate sets of protected tracks.

Subtitle tracks are only included in the CMSF namespaces; LOC and moq-mi carry
video and audio only.

### LOC (`msf/clear`)

The LOC namespace uses MSF with `packaging=loc` per [MSF][MSF] and [LOC][LOC].
Objects carry raw codec bitstream without container framing. For a combined
AV1 spatial-SVC source such as `video.mp4`, the publisher automatically replaces
the aggregate LOC catalog entry with dependent tracks:

```text
video/s0  spatialId=0
video/s1  spatialId=1  depends=["video/s0"]
video/s2  spatialId=2  depends=["video/s1"]
```

Every track has aligned group/object IDs and timestamps. RFC 9626 frame marking
identifies its spatial layer, while sequence configuration is carried only by
base-layer sync objects. This projection is LOC-only: CMSF continues to expose
the original combined `video` track. The bundled `mlmsub` does not yet merge
dependent SVC tracks for playback.

On the subscriber side, `mlmsub` reframes LOC video (length-prefixed NALUs
→ AnnexB) and LOC audio (raw AAC → ADTS) so the output can be piped directly
to ffplay. Only AAC-LC (`mp4a.40.2`) is supported for LOC audio at the
moment; HE-AAC and other object types are rejected.

### moq-mi (`moq-mi/clear`)

The moq-mi namespace implements
[draft-cenzano-moq-media-interop][moq-mi]. It has no catalog: the subscriber
uses fixed track names (`video0`, `audio0`) and parses per-object moqmi
extension headers to learn the media type and codec metadata. Payloads are
the codec bitstream as defined by moqmi (AVCC length-prefixed NALUs for
video, raw frames for AAC/Opus) and are written through unchanged by `mlmsub`
— this namespace is intended for interop testing, not direct ffplay playback.

### LOCMAF (within the `cmsf/*` namespaces)

LOCMAF (Low Overhead CMAF) is a compact CMAF packaging in which only the
non-derivable `moof` fields are sent on the wire; the receiver reconstructs
standard CMAF media fragments so the normal CMAF playback path is reused
unchanged. LOCMAF is **not** a separate namespace: within each `cmsf/*` catalog
every rendition is offered both as a CMAF track `<name>` (`packaging: "cmaf"`)
and as a LOCMAF track `<name>_locmaf` (`packaging: "locmaf"`), listed as
alternates in the same `altGroup`. The two variants share one init-data entry
(the raw CMAF init segment) referenced by `initRef`. Because all fields needed
for playback — including per-sample encryption metadata — are carried, the
LOCMAF variant is offered for the encrypted `cmsf/drm-{scheme}` and
`cmsf/eccp-{scheme}` catalogs too (`<name>_drm_locmaf` / `<name>_eccp_locmaf`).

The codec is **not** implemented in this repository. Encode/decode comes from
the reusable Go module
[github.com/Eyevinn/locmaf](https://github.com/Eyevinn/locmaf), and the catalog
advertises `locmafVersion` from `locmaf.Version` (currently **0.3**). `mlmpub`
encodes each chunk with `locmaf.EncodeCanonical`; `mlmsub` expands received
Objects back to CMAF with `locmaf.Decode` + `locmaf.ReconstructCanonical` and
rejects tracks whose `locmafVersion` it does not implement. One packaging
version is supported at a time — v0.2 remains reachable at the `locmaf-v0.2`
tag.

The normative wire format is specified by the IETF draft
[draft-einarsson-moq-locmaf](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-einarsson-moq-locmaf/);
see [`docs/LOCMAF.md`](docs/LOCMAF.md) for how moqlivemock uses the module. The
reference test-asset generator (golden-vector corpus) and the round-trip
fidelity/overhead tool live in the `locmaf` module's CLI, alongside the codec.

## Session setup

After session establishment, the server announces all configured namespaces.
For CMSF and LOC namespaces the client retrieves the catalog track first, then
subscribes to the media tracks listed in that catalog. For moq-mi there is no
catalog, so the client subscribes directly to the fixed track names.

By default the catalog is retrieved with a SUBSCRIBE (Filter Type = Largest
Object) plus a relative joining FETCH at offset 0, per
[draft-ietf-moq-msf-01][msf-01] §5, so the client gets the latest catalog group
aligned to the live edge in a single round-trip. The `mlmsub -catalog-mode` flag
selects the strategy: `joining` (default), `subscribe` (legacy plain SUBSCRIBE),
or `fetch` (legacy standalone FETCH).

The bundled `mlmsub` client connects to a single namespace (default: `cmsf/clear`,
configurable via `-namespace`). It subscribes to the first video and audio track
from the catalog or tracks that match `-videoname`, `-audioname`.
For subtitles, see below.

## Subtitle Tracks

The publisher generates subtitle tracks dynamically, showing UTC timestamp and group number.
Two subtitle formats are supported:

- **WVTT** (WebVTT in CMAF) - codec: `wvtt`
- **STPP** (TTML in CMAF) - codec: `stpp.ttml.im1t`

By default, one Swedish WVTT track (`subs_wvtt_sv`) and one English STPP track (`subs_stpp_en`) are created.
You can configure multiple languages:

```shell
# Multiple languages for both formats
./mlmpub -subswvtt "en,sv,de" -subsstpp "en,fr"

# Only WVTT subtitles
./mlmpub -subswvtt "en,sv" -subsstpp ""

# No subtitles
./mlmpub -subswvtt "" -subsstpp ""
```

Subtitle track names follow the pattern `subs_wvtt_{lang}` and `subs_stpp_{lang}`.

To receive subtitles with the mlmsub subscriber:

```shell
# Subscribe to WVTT subtitles
./mlmsub -subsout subs.mp4 -subsname wvtt

# Subscribe to a specific language
./mlmsub -subsout subs_sv.mp4 -subsname subs_wvtt_sv
```

## Requirements

* Go 1.25 or later

## Installation and Usage

As usual with Go, run

```shell
go mod tidy
```

to get up and running.

There are three commands

* `mlmpub` is the server and publisher
* `mlmsub` is the client and subscriber
* `mlmtest` is an interop test client for the [moq-interop-runner][interop-runner]

The content used is in the `assets/test10s` directory, and was
generated using the tools in `utils/contentgen`.

### Encode the AV1 spatial-SVC test video

A ready-to-run AV1 spatial-SVC fixture is already included at
`assets/testsvc/video.mp4`. The steps below are only needed to regenerate it.

Install build tools and FFmpeg on Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git ninja-build ffmpeg
```

Build and install libaom's `svc_encoder_rtc` example:

```shell
svc_build_dir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/libaom-svc.XXXXXX)
git clone --depth 1 --branch v3.13.0-rc1 \
  https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom "$svc_build_dir/aom"
cmake -S "$svc_build_dir/aom" -B "$svc_build_dir/build" -G Ninja \
  -DENABLE_EXAMPLES=1 \
  -DENABLE_TESTS=0 \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0 \
  -DAOM_TARGET_CPU=generic
cmake --build "$svc_build_dir/build" --target svc_encoder_rtc
sudo install -m 0755 "$svc_build_dir/build/svc_encoder_rtc" \
  /usr/local/bin/svc_encoder_rtc
```

Generate the combined three-spatial-layer fragmented MP4 and replace the test
fixture:

```shell
cd utils/contentgen
SVC_ENCODER_PATH=/usr/local/bin/svc_encoder_rtc \
  go run videogen.go -codecs svc
cp output/video.mp4 ../../assets/testsvc/video.mp4
```

The result contains 320x180, 640x360, and 1280x720 AV1 spatial layers. See
[`utils/contentgen/README.md`](utils/contentgen/README.md) for encoder settings
and other codecs.

### Run spatial-SVC with WARP Player

From `moqlivemock-svc/cmd/mlmpub`, generate the short-lived certificate when
needed, then start the publisher:

```shell
./generate-webtransport-cert.sh
go run . \
  -asset ../../assets/testsvc \
  -cert cert-fp.pem \
  -key key-fp.pem \
  -sideport 8081
```

In another terminal:

```shell
cd ../../../warp-player-svc
npm install
npm start
```

Open `https://localhost:8080`, then use:

```text
MoQ server URL:  https://localhost:4443/moq
Fingerprint URL: http://localhost:8081/fingerprint
Namespace:       msf/clear
Engine:          WebCodecs
```

Choose `video/s0`, `video/s1`, or `video/s2`, then press **Start**. Selecting
`s1` subscribes `s0+s1`; selecting `s2` subscribes `s0+s1+s2`.

To run the system, first start the publisher

```shell
cd cmd/mlmpub
go run .
```

You can also build the binary and then run it

```shell
cd cmd/mlmpub
go build .
./mlmpub
```

You can also specify options for the publisher:

```shell
./mlmpub -audiobatch 4 -videobatch 2
```

In another shell, start the subscriber and choose if the video, the audio,
or a muxed combination should be output, e.g.

```shell
cd cmd/mlmsub
go run . -muxout - | ffplay -
```

or build it similarly to `mlmpub` before you run it. This time with some other options

```shell
cd cmd/mlmsub
go build .
./mlmsub -videoname 600 -audioname scale -loglevel debug -muxout - | ffplay -
```

to directly play with ffplay.
There are more options to change the loglevel, choose track etc.

The subscriber will connect to the publisher and start receiving
video and audio frames if some tracks are selected.

### Use with Eyevinn's browser player

The browser player [warp-player][warp-player] has been created to match the
mlmpub publisher. It will subscribe to and read a catalog.
One can then choose video and audio tracks and start playing synchronized
video and audio with configurable latency.

For that to work, one either need certificates or use of the fingerprint mechanism.

#### Using mkcert (recommended for development)

One way to do that is with mkcert:

```sh
> mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
> mkcert -install
> go run . -cert cert.pem -key key.pem
```

#### Using certificate fingerprint

For browsers that support WebTransport certificate fingerprints (e.g., Chrome),
you can use self-signed certificates without installing them. This is especially
useful when running the server locally.

**Run mlmpub with fingerprint support**:
```sh
> go run . -sideport 8081
```

This will automatically generate a WebTransport-compatible certificate with:
- ECDSA algorithm (not RSA)
- 14-day validity (WebTransport maximum)
- Self-signed

Alternatively, you can use your own certificate (e.g., generated with the included `generate-webtransport-cert.sh` script):
```sh
cd cmd/mlmpub
./generate-webtransport-cert.sh
go run . -cert cert-fp.pem -key key-fp.pem -sideport 8081
```

This will:
- Start the MoQ server on port 4443 (default address is `0.0.0.0:4443`, listening on all interfaces)
- Start an HTTP side server on port 8081 serving `/fingerprint` and `/clearkey`
- Validate that the certificate meets WebTransport requirements

The warp-player can then connect using:
- Server URL: `https://localhost:4443/moq` or `https://127.0.0.1:4443/moq`
- Fingerprint URL: `http://localhost:8081/fingerprint` or `http://127.0.0.1:8081/fingerprint`

**Notes**:
- The side server is disabled by default (`-sideport 0`).
  Enable it when using certificate fingerprints or ClearKey/ECCP encryption.
- If no certificate files are provided, mlmpub will generate WebTransport-compatible certificates automatically.

### Using DRM

moqlivemock supports two independent content protection modes that can run simultaneously:

#### ClearKey / ECCP (explicit key)

Use `-kid`, `-iv`, and optionally `-cenckey` flags. If no cenc key is provided, the
key-id is used as the key. The ClearKey license endpoint is served at `/clearkey` on
the side server, so `-sideport` must be set. For production behind a reverse proxy,
use `-laurl` to specify the external license URL announced in the catalog. The ClearKey license server always returns the key id as the cenc key, so `-kid` must match `-cenckey`.

```sh
# Local development
go run . -kid 39112233445566778899aabbccddeeff -iv 41112233445566778899aabbccddeeff -scheme cbcs -sideport 8081

# Behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Caddy forwarding /clearkey → localhost:8081/clearkey)
go run . -kid 39112233445566778899aabbccddeeff -iv 41112233445566778899aabbccddeeff -scheme cbcs \
         -sideport 8081 -laurl https://moqlivemock.demo.osaas.io/clearkey
```

This announces the `cmsf/eccp-cbcs` namespace with tracks like `video_400kbps_avc_eccp` (each also offered as a `_locmaf` variant).

#### Commercial DRM (CPIX)

Use `-drmpath` pointing to a config JSON file in the same format as `assets/testdrm/drm_config_test.json`.
Supported systems: Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay.

```sh
go run . -drmpath ../../assets/testdrm/drm_config_test.json
```

This announces the `cmsf/drm-{scheme}` namespace with tracks like `video_400kbps_avc_drm` (each also offered as a `_locmaf` variant).

#### Both simultaneously

Both modes can be active at the same time, each with independent encryption keys:

```sh
go run . -drmpath ../../assets/drm/drm_config.json \
         -kid 39112233445566778899aabbccddeeff -iv 41112233445566778899aabbccddeeff -scheme cbcs \
         -sideport 8081 -laurl https://moqlivemock.demo.osaas.io/clearkey
```

This announces three CMSF namespaces: `cmsf/clear`, `cmsf/drm-cbcs`, and `cmsf/eccp-cbcs`. Each catalog carries both the CMAF and the LOCMAF (`_locmaf`) track variants.

#### Subscriber examples

The subscriber uses information from the catalog to make license requests,
so no extra flags are needed except choosing the right namespace and track names:

```sh
# Clear content (default namespace)
go run . -muxout - | ffplay -

# ECCP-protected content
go run . -namespace cmsf/eccp-cbcs -videoname _eccp -audioname _eccp -muxout - | ffplay -

# DRM-protected content
go run . -namespace cmsf/drm-cbcs -videoname _drm -audioname _drm -muxout - | ffplay -

# LOC packaging — AVC reframed to AnnexB, AAC reframed to ADTS
go run . -namespace msf/clear -videoout video.h264 -audioout audio.aac
ffplay video.h264
ffplay audio.aac

# moq-mi packaging — raw moqmi payloads written through unchanged
go run . -namespace moq-mi/clear -videoout video0.bin -audioout audio0.bin

# LOCMAF variant (inside cmsf/clear) — select the _locmaf tracks
go run . -namespace cmsf/clear -videoname _avc_locmaf -audioname _aac_locmaf -muxout - | ffplay -
```

### LOCMAF test assets and round-trip tooling

The reference test-asset generator (golden-vector corpus) and the round-trip
fidelity/overhead tool moved out of this repository together with the codec.
They now live in the `locmaf` CLI in the
[github.com/Eyevinn/locmaf](https://github.com/Eyevinn/locmaf) module; see that
repository for usage.

## QUIC / WebTransport Configuration

Since `quic-go` v0.59.0 and `webtransport-go` v0.10.0, the QUIC config must enable
`EnableStreamResetPartialDelivery` in addition to `EnableDatagrams`. Without it,
WebTransport connections will fail with `ERR_METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED` in the browser.

For WebTransport servers, `webtransport.ConfigureHTTP3Server(h3Server)` must also be
called before serving connections. This sets the `ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT` HTTP/3 setting
that browsers require during the WebTransport handshake.

Example QUIC config:

```go
&quic.Config{
    EnableDatagrams:                  true,
    EnableStreamResetPartialDelivery: true,
}
```

## Development

Use plain Go environment, with go 1.25 or later.
